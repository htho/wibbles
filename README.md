# Wibbles - W(eb) (N)ibbles

Do you remember [NIBBLES.BAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nibbles_(video_game)) from your old DOS Computer? Well I do. But I also remember ["Der Wurm"](http://www.dngames.de/old/wurm.html) by "Digital Nightmares". I spent days playing it as a child. Also the multi player mode was a lot of fun.

Wibbles (Nibbles on the Web) is a Snake variant that takes the concept of "Der Wurm"/"The Worm" and ports it to the web.
